# Chapter: Introduction to Git
## What is Git:
- It is a version control system
- It keeps a historical record of each save.
- Git works on a local machine.
- Git thinks about its data more like a stream of snapshots

### Goals of Git (inception in 2005):
1. Speed
2. Simple Design 
3. Strong support for non-linear development (thousands of parallel branches)
4. Fully Distributed
5. Able to handle large projects
