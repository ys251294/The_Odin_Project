      <h3>Description:</h3>
      <p><em>According to Wikipedia</em></p>
      <p>
        Shahi paneer is a preparation of Paneer, native to the Indian
        subcontinent, consisting of a thick gravy of cream, tomatoes and Indian
        spices.
      </p>
      <p>
        Originating with the creamy delicacies of Mughlai cuisine (hence the
        term "shahi", in reference to the royal title of Shahanshah in Mughal
        India), this dish is prepared by emulsifying tomatoes, onions, ground
        cashews, clarified butter and cream into a curry, with the addition of
        paneer cubes and a variety of spices.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is mainly eaten with traditional Indian flat-breads like roti or
        naan, rice and bread. Paneer is derived from the Persian word for
        cheese, and shahi is the term for royal (in reference to the Imperial
        Court of the Mughal Empire).

      <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons cooking oil</li>
        <li>1 large onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
        <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>
          <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> teaspoon Kashmiri red chili powder
        </li>
        <li>4 tomatoes, pureed</li>
        <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> pound paneer, cubed</li>
        <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> cup water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>

        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Steps:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook the onion and
          garlic in the hot oil until the onions are soft and golden brown,
          about 5 minutes. Sprinkle the cumin, coriander, turmeric, and chili
          powder over the onion and garlic; continue cooking until the
          seasonings are fragrant, about 30 seconds.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pour the pureed tomatoes into the skillet; cook until the excess
          liquid evaporates and the oil separates, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the
          paneer, water, sugar, and salt to the mixture; stir gently so the
          paneer does not break apart. Cook until the paneer begins to absorb
          some of the liquid, about 10 minutes. Stir the cream into the mixture
          and simmer another 5 minutes. Garnish with cilantro to serve.
