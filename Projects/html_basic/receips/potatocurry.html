      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p><em>According to Wikipedia</em></p>
      <p>
        A curry is a dish with a sauce seasoned with spices, mainly associated
        with South Asian cuisine. In southern India, leaves from the curry tree
        may be included.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many varieties of curry. In traditional cuisines, the
        selection of spices for each dish is a matter of national or regional
        cultural tradition, religious practice, and preference of the chef. Such
        dishes have names that refer to their ingredients, spicing, and cooking
        methods. Outside the Indian subcontinent, a curry is a dish from
        Southeast Asia which uses coconut milk or spice pastes, commonly eaten
        over rice. Curries may contain fish, meat, poultry, or shellfish, either
        alone or in combination with vegetables. Others are vegetarian. Dry
        curries are cooked using small amounts of liquid, which is allowed to
        evaporate, leaving the other ingredients coated with the spice mixture.
        Wet curries contain significant amounts of sauce or gravy based on
        broth, coconut cream or coconut milk, dairy cream or yogurt, or legume
        purée, sautéed crushed onion, or tomato purée.
